Hello, I'm Sam, a hobbyist developer with a passion for tinkering with electronics.

##### About Me

I tend to work on projects for a short period before moving on to something new. Currently, I'm focused on writing code for robots ⚙️ and creating financial models using AI. While most of my significant projects are closed source, I typically open source them once they're complete.

### Technologies I work with

###### Languages

- [TypeScript / JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Java](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/doc/building.md)
- Python 
- HTML / CSS + React
- C++
