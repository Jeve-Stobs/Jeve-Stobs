Hello! I'm Sam, hobbyist developer who enjoys tinkering with electronics. 

##### About Me

I work on projects for a short amount of time and then I usually move on. Currently tinkering with the Discord API and diving deep into rust-lang. Most of my major projects are closed source, but when I finish a project, I usually open source it.

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
