# Hi there üëã

Hello! I'm Samuel, a 15 y/o backend/frontend developer who enjoys coding more than life itself. 

##### About Me

I'm a relatively new developer, but I have been interested in computers and anything mechanical from day one. I work on projects for a short amount of time, and then I usually move on. My current project is a Discord music bot, [Acoustic](https://github.com/acousticly). I've also made some custom Elixir + Java libraries to improve WebSocket response time & provide cleaner sound to client devices.
